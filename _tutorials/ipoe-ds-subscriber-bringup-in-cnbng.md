## Introduction
To bringup an IPoE subscriber in cnBNG. We need to setup some initial configurations on both cnBNG CP and cnBNG UP (ASR9k). In this tutorial we will bringup an IPoE DS subscriber session with plan policies and required ACL received during authorization from freeradius.  

## Topology
In this topology we are using CSR1000v as the CPE, cnBNG will assign both IPv4 and IPv6 (NA + PD) prefixes to CPE. The prefix assignment will happen through IPAM which is integral part of cnBNG CP. 

Radius profile configured here is to activate 100mbps plan service with v4 and v6 ACLs applied to dynamic subscriber interface on UP.

## Prerequisite:
- cnBNG CP is already deployed and Ops Center is accessible. We will be using Ops Center CLI interface for configurations in this tutorial
- cnBNG CP service network can reach cnBNG UP:
	- In multi VM deployment, this means protocol VM VIP for service network is reachable from cnBNG UP for PFCP communications
    - In single Node/VM AIO deployment, this means AIO VM IP is reachable from cnBNG UP

## Initial cnBNG CP Configurations (Optional)
If you have deployed cnBNG CP a fresh then most probably, initial cnBNG CP configuration is not applied on Ops Center. Follow below steps to apply initial configuratuon to cnBNG CP Ops Center

- SSH login to cnBNG CP Ops Center CLI

```
cisco@pod100-cnbng-cp:~$ ssh admin@10.0.100.1 -p 2024         
Warning: Permanently added '[10.0.100.1]:2024' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

- Change to config mode in Ops Center

```
[pod100/bng] bng# config
Entering configuration mode terminal
[pod100/bng] bng(config)# 
```

- Apply following initial configuration. With changes to "endpoint radius" and "udp proxy" configs. Both "endpoint radius" and "udp-proxy" should use IP of cnBNG CP service network side protocol VIP or in case of AIO it should be the IP of AIO VM used for peering between cnBNG CP and UP.

## cnBNG CP Configuration

cnBNG CP Configuration has following constructs/parts:
- IPAM
- Profile DHCP
- Profile AAA
- Profile Radius
- Profile Feature-Template
- Profile Subscriber
- User-Plane

Let's understand each one in step-by-step and apply in Ops Center in config mode.

### IPAM
This is where we define subscriber address pools for IPv4, IPv6 (NA) and IPv6 (PD). These are the pools from which CPE will get the IPs. IPAM assigns addresses dynamically by splitting address pools into smaller chunks. And then associating each chunk with a user-plane. The pools get freed up dynamically and re-allocated to different user-planes on need basis. 

```
ipam
 instance 1
  source local
  address-pool pool-ISP1
   vrf-name default
   ipv4
    split-size
     per-cache 65536
     per-dp    65536
    exit
    address-range 110.0.0.1 110.10.255.255
   exit
   ipv6
    address-ranges
     split-size
      per-cache 65536
      per-dp    65536
     exit
     address-range f:2::1 f:2::10:ffff
    exit
    prefix-ranges
     split-size
      per-cache 65536
      per-dp    65536
     exit
     prefix-range 2001:db1:: length 48
    exit
   exit
  exit
 exit
exit
```

### Profile DHCP
At present cnBNG only supports DHCP server option. That means cnBNG CP acts as a DHCP server to assign IPs to CPE/subscribers. In profile DHCP we define the DHCP server and which IPAM pool to use by default for subscriber. We can use different pools for IPv4, IPv6 (IANA) and IPv6 (IAPD).

```
profile dhcp dhcp-server1
 ipv4
  mode server
  server
   pool-name   pool-ISP1
   dns-servers [ 8.8.8.8 ]
   lease days 1
  exit
 exit
 ipv6
  mode server
  server
   iana-pool-name pool-ISP1
   iapd-pool-name pool-ISP1
   lease days 1
  exit
 exit
exit
```

### Profile AAA
This profile defines the AAA parameters, like which Radius group to be used authorization and accounting. Also what username value to be used. Here we also define other attrbutes and formats. In this example we will be using MAC based authorization

```
profile aaa aaa_mac
 authorization
  type subscriber method-order [ local ]
  username identifier client-mac-address
  password cisco
 exit
 accounting
  method-order [ local ]
 exit
exit
```

### Profile Radius
Under this profile, Radius groups are created.

```
profile server-group local
 radius-group local
exit

profile radius
 algorithm round-robin
 deadtime  3
 detect-dead-server response-timeout 60
 max-retry 2
 timeout   5
!! Use your radius IP and port for auth here. Here we use 10.0.100.4 as Radius IP with 1812 auth port and 1813 acct port
 server 10.0.100.4 1812
  type   auth
  secret cisco
 exit
 server 10.0.100.4  1813
  type   acct
  secret cisco
 exit
 attribute
  nas-identifier CISCO-cnBNG
!! This should be CP UDP Proxy IP
  nas-ip         10.0.100.1
 exit
 server-group local
  server auth 10.0.100.4 1812
  exit
  server acct 10.0.100.4 1813
  exit
 exit
exit
!! We can also set COA client, use client IP as per the setup
profile coa
 client 10.0.100.4
  server-key cisco
 exit
exit
```

### Profile Feature-template
This profile defines subscriber feature template. This is the template which will be applied to dynamic subscriber interface. We also enable service/ session accounting here.

```
profile feature-template ipoe-1
 vrf-name default
 ipv4
  mtu 1500
 exit
 session-accounting
  enable
  aaa-profile       aaa_mac
  periodic-interval 1800
 exit
exit
```

We can also define service profiles using feature-template, which gets applied on per subscriber session. The service profile in case of radius can be applied during authorization using service activate attribute or it can also be applied using CoA.

```
profile feature-template FT_Plan_100mbps
 qos
  in-policy  PM_Plan_100mbps_input
  out-policy PM_Plan_100mbps_output
 exit
exit
```

**Note**: In above policy-map PM_Plan_100mbps_input and PM_Plan_100mbps_output are expected to be defined on userplane.
{: .notice--info}

### Profile Subscriber
This profile can be attached on per access port level or per user-plane level. This profile for IPoE defines which dhcp server profile to applu, along with feature-template and profile for aaa auth. 

```
profile subscriber subscriber-profile_ipoe-1
 dhcp-profile               dhcp-server1
 session-type               ipv4v6
 activate-feature-templates [ ipoe-1 ]
 aaa authorize aaa_mac
exit
```

### User-plane
This construct define the association configs. Peering IP as well as subscriber profile to be attached to user-plane or at port level.

```
user-plane ASR9k-1
!! This should be UP IP to which to peer
 peer-address ipv4 10.0.100.2
 subscriber-profile subscriber-profile_ipoe-1
exit
```

## cnBNG UP Configuration

UP Configuration has mainly three constructs and then feature definitions specially QoS and ACL

- Loopback for BNG and association/cnbng-nal Configurations
- DHCP Configuration
- Access Interface

### Loopback Creation
We need to create a Loopback for BNG use.

```
interface Loopback1
 ipv6 enable
```

### Association Configuration

This is where we define association between cnBNG CP and UP. The auto-loopback with secondary-address-upadte enabled will make sure we are able to assign IPs dynamically from IPAM. 

cnbng-nal location 0/RP0/CPU0
 hostidentifier ASR9k-1
 up-server ipv4 10.0.100.2 vrf default
 cp-server primary ipv4 10.0.100.1
 auto-loopback vrf default
  interface Loopback1
!! Any dummy IP
   primary-address 1.1.1.1
  !
 !
!! retry-count specifies how many times UP should retry the connection with CP before declaring CP as dead
 cp-association retry-count 10
 secondary-address-update enable
!

**Note**: NAL stands for Network Adaptation Layer for Cloud Native BNG in IOS-XR
{: .notice--info}

### DHCP Configuration
This is where we associate access interfaces with cnBNG DHCP profile. cnBNG specific DHCP profile makes sure DHCP packets are punted to cnBNG CP through CPRi/GTP-u tunnel.

```
dhcp ipv4
 profile cnbng_v4 cnbng
 !
 interface Bundle-Ether1.101 cnbng profile cnbng_v4

dhcp ipv6
 profile cnbng_v6 cnbng
 !
 interface Bundle-Ether1.101 cnbng profile cnbng_v6
```

### Access Interface Configuration
We define and associate access interface to cnBNG. This way control packets (based on configurations) get routed to the cnBNG CP. The contruct follows ASR9k Integarted BNG model, if you are familiar with.

```
interface Bundle-Ether1.101
 ipv4 point-to-point
 ipv4 unnumbered Loopback1
 ipv6 address 2001::1/64
 ipv6 enable
 load-interval 30
 encapsulation dot1q 101
 ipsubscriber
  ipv4 l2-connected
   initiator dhcp
  !
  ipv6 l2-connected
   initiator dhcp
  !
 !
!
```

## CPE Configs
Following is CSR1000v config which is used as CPE in this example.

```
interface Bundle-Ether1.101
 encapsulation dot1Q 101
 ip address dhcp
 ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit
 ipv6 address autoconfig
 ipv6 dhcp client pd prefix-from-isp
```

## Radius Profile
Following is Freeradius profile used in this tutorial

```
0050.5688.61ae Cleartext-Password := "cisco"
   Cisco-AVpair += "subscriber:sa=FT_Plan_100mbps",
   Cisco-AVpair += "subscriber:inacl=iACL_BNG_IPv4",
   Cisco-AVpair += "subscriber:ipv6_inacl=iACL_BNG_IPv6"
```
